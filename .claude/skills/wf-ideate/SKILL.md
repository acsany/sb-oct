# Ideate — Create a GitHub Issue

Turn an idea or problem into a well-structured GitHub issue.

## Context

- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Recent commits: !`git log --oneline -5`

## The Idea

$ARGUMENTS

## Steps

### 1. Clarify

Ask the user clarifying questions about the idea before writing anything. Use the AskUserQuestion tool for that. Understand:
- What problem does this solve?
- What should the end result look like?
- Are there constraints or preferences?

### 2. Research

If the idea involves packages, APIs, or frameworks used in the project, look up the **official documentation only** (not blog posts or unofficial GitHub repos).

Use `WebFetch` to pull official docs when needed.

### 3. Write the Issue

Create a GitHub issue that includes:
- A clear title
- Problem description or motivation
- Implementation suggestions (high-level, not a full plan)
- Any relevant links to official docs

Use `gh issue create` to create the issue.

**Do NOT plan the implementation.** The goal is a well-written issue that another developer can pick up — not a step-by-step execution plan.
